        <td>Traditional HTML (before HTML5) had a simpler syntax and fewer semantic elements. It primarily focused on defining the structure of a web page using basic tags like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, etc.</td>
        <td> HTML5 introduced new semantic elements (&lt;article&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, etc.) that provide more meaningful ways to structure content. It also introduced simplified doctype declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>), which is easier to remember and use.

        <td>Enhanced form controls and new input types (email, url, tel, date, number, etc.) were introduced for better user input validation and user experience. Attributes like required, pattern, and autocomplete were also added to improve form handling.</td>

       <tr>
        <td>Older HTML versions required more consideration for cross-browser compatibility, and handling unsupported features could be more challenging.</td>
